# OK K.O.! BoxMore Break-in: Cool Story Co-Bruh

Our game is centered around Co-Bruh, an action hero with snakes for hands who enjoys knitting. With K.O. trapped, he must navigate through enemy territory while managing his snake hands. Since he has trouble knitting with his hands, he has only had time to put one scarf on a snake. So as the game progresses, the other snake gets too cold, fussy and jealous. When the snakes get to that state they start alerting any enemies around Co-Bruh. Before this happens, Co-Bruh must take care of his snake hands by alternating the scarves through a series of mini games all while the enemies continue to patrol.
